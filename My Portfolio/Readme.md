 I will be building from scratch using HTML,CSS AND Javascript.I will be learning how to implement them properly by doing the best possible action,i.e practice!!

I want to learn Front-end development as I LIKE to design in general, and what better way could be there to see your designs in action than building something out of it.

This will take time as I am doing this a side project(learning).I am not good at it and thats the whole purpose of making it.

If you are seeing this,thanks for checking it out. Feel free to contact me to drop me with some help or advice.
