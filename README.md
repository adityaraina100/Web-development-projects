A repository showcasing my web development progress and journey. I will be using HTML5,CSS and Javascript and although I am a complete beginner,i hope to learn more and more by hands-on practice. I will try to soon switch up to BOOTSTRAP AND TAILWINDCSS as I become a little more proficent in making websites from the sratch.
