# Web-development-projects



A repository showcasing my web development progress and journey. I will be using HTML5,CSS,Javascript,BootStrap and other front-end tech and frameworks. Although I am a complete beginner,i hope to learn more and more by hands-on practice. Currently I am learning Bootstrap and after that I will try to soon switch up to TAILWINDCSS as I become a little more proficent in making websites from the sratch.


(Each Project has a live demo in its respective directory)
